## Hi there 👋

My name is Cris, and I'm a fullstack developer! I have experience with the React/Typescript/AWS stack on a professional level, and have worked on some personal projects with the likes of Python, Flutter, and Unity. I am currently seeking full-time employment.

### What I'm currently working on 

Currently I'm polishing up my project, and after that I will be remaking my portfolio using something other than Flutter (probably [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/))!

I'm also looking to redesign my personal portfolio soon, but I haven't gotten started on that quite yet.
